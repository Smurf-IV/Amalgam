This will make an FTP target appear as a source drive within the windows OS (i.e. in Explorer or a DOS box). It will allow Media playback, file updates, backup programs etc. to function as if they are talking to networked shared drive.</p>
<h2>OS Requirements:</h2>
<p>This uses the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17718">
.Net4 x32 <em>Full</em> profile</a>, so please install that.<br>
You will also need to install <a href="http://dokan-dev.net/en/download/">Dokan </a>
for the OS you are using.</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>Q</strong> Aren't there other (<em><a href="http://amalgam.codeplex.com/discussions/258996">free) offerings</a></em> that do this?<br>
<strong>A</strong> Yes there are, but I was not able to find one that worked reliably and at the full potential of both read and write speeds in Win 7 and above.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong> Why do this?<br>
<strong>A</strong> I wanted a drive that took an FTP target and placed it into windows as a drive in explorer (and dos); so that Media players could extract data and play large 1080p files without jitter.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong> Why C#?<br>
<strong>A</strong> This is so that any memory that is being used is tidied up cleanly by the OS, and to make any interface pretty via the use of WCF (later on :-))<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong> Hasn't Dokan got a <em>few</em> issues?<br>
<strong>A</strong> Yes, but these are mainly to do with security access, and mapped file access.
<br>
<strong>A2</strong> By (currently) setting the Dokan driver to be a network drive, this allows a lot of the
<em>problem</em> applications to work (e.g. notepad is the quickest to show these problems)<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong> What about WebDav?<br>
<strong>A</strong> I suppose that this could be extended to perform such functions, but currently is beyond the scope of this first phase.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q</strong> What about SFTP / FTPS ?<br>
<strong>A</strong> The StarkSoftFTP library does have this functionality, and it could be used later on - any volunteers to take that part on ?</p>
